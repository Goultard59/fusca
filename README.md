# FUSCA
Framework for Unified Single-Cell Analysis (FUSCA) is a software package for single-cell data analysis developed in R. At the moment, it contains two modules: 1) CellRouter, for reconstruction of complex single-cell trajectories, and 2) CellComm, to infer intercellular communication networks from scRNA-seq data.

#### Tutorial for using the CellComm tool in spatial transcriptomics analysis [Link](https://github.com/edroaldo/fusca/blob/main/tutorial/CellComm_tutorial.ipynb).
